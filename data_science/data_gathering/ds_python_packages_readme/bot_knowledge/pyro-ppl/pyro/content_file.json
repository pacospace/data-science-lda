Notably, it was designed with these principles in mind:\n\n- **Universal**: Pyro is a universal PPL - it can represent any computable probability distribution.\n- **Scalable**: Pyro scales to large data sets with little overhead compared to hand-written code.\n- **Minimal**: Pyro is agile and maintainable. It is implemented with a small core of powerful, composable abstractions.\n- **Flexible**: Pyro aims for automation when you want it, control when you need it. This is accomplished through high-level abstractions to express generative and inference models, while allowing experts easy-access to customize inference.\n\nPyro is developed and maintained by [Uber AI Labs](http://uber.ai) and community contributors.\nFor more information, check out our [blog post](http://eng.uber.com/pyro).\n\n## Installing\n\n### Installing a stable Pyro release\n\n**Install using pip:**\n\nPyro supports Python 3.4+.\n\n```sh\npip install pyro-ppl\n```\n\n**Install from source:**\n```sh\ngit clone git@github.com:pyro-ppl/pyro.git\ncd pyro\ngit checkout master  # master is pinned to the latest release\npip install .\n```\n\n**Install with extra packages:**\n\nTo install the dependencies required to run the probabilistic models included in the `examples`/`tutorials` directories, please use the following command:\n```sh\npip install pyro-ppl[extras] \n```\nMake sure that the models come from the same release version of the [Pyro source code](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/releases) as you have installed.\n\n### Installing Pyro dev branch\n\nFor recent features you can install Pyro from source.\n\n**Install using pip:**\n\n```sh\npip install git+https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro.git\n```\n\nor, with the `extras` dependency to run the probabilistic models included in the `examples`/`tutorials` directories:\n```sh\npip install git+https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro.git#egg=project[extras]\n```\n\n**Install from source:**\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro\ncd pyro\npip install .  # pip install .[extras] for running models in examples/tutorials\n```\n\n## Running Pyro from a Docker Container\n\nRefer to the instructions [here](docker/README.md).\n\n## Citation\nIf you use Pyro, please consider citing:\n```\n@article{bingham2019pyro,\n  author    = {Eli Bingham and\n               Jonathan P.
