Right now, its primary use is for building Markov models of large corpora of text and generating random sentences from that. However, in theory, it could be used for [other applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Applications).\n\n- [Why Markovify?](#why-markovify)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Basic Usage](#basic-usage)\n- [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage)\n- [Markovify In The Wild](#markovify-in-the-wild)\n- [Thanks](#thanks)\n\n## Why Markovify?\n\nSome reasons:\n\n- Simplicity. \"Batteries included,\" but it is easy to override key methods.\n\n- Models can be stored as JSON, allowing you to cache your results and save them for later.\n\n- Text parsing and sentence generation methods are highly extensible, allowing you to set your own rules.\n\n- Relies only on pure-Python libraries, and very few of them.\n\n- Tested on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\npip install markovify\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n```python\nimport markovify\n\n# Get raw text as string.\nwith open(\"/path/to/my/corpus.txt\") as f:\n    text = f.read()\n\n# Build the model.\ntext_model = markovify.Text(text)\n\n# Print five randomly-generated sentences\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(text_model.make_sentence())\n\n# Print three randomly-generated sentences of no more than 280 characters\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(text_model.make_short_sentence(280))\n```\n\nNotes:\n\n- The usage examples here assume you are trying to markovify text. If you would like to use the underlying `markovify.Chain` class, which is not text-specific, check out [the (annotated) source code](markovify/chain.py).\n\n- Markovify works best with large, well-punctuated texts. If your text does not use `.`s to delineate sentences, put each sentence on a newline, and use the `markovify.NewlineText` class instead of `markovify.Text` class.\n\n- If you have accidentally read the input text as one long sentence, markovify will be unable to generate new sentences from it due to a lack of beginning and ending delimiters. This issue can occur if you have read a newline delimited file using the `markovify.Text` command instead of `markovify.NewlineText`. To check this, the command `[key for key in txt.chain.model.keys() if \"___BEGIN__\" in key]` command will return all of the possible sentence-starting words and should return more than one result.\n\n- By default, the `make_sentence` method tries a maximum of 10 times per invocation, to make a sentence that does not overlap too much\u00a0with the original text. If it is successful, the method returns the sentence as a string. If not, it returns `None`. To increase or decrease the number of attempts, use the `tries` keyword argument, e.g., call `.make_sentence(tries=100)`.\n\n- By default, `markovify.Text` tries to generate sentences that do not simply regurgitate chunks of the original text. The default rule is to suppress any generated sentences that exactly overlaps the original text by 15 words or 70% of the sentence's word count. You can change this rule by passing `max_overlap_ratio` and/or `max_overlap_total` to the `make_sentence` method. Alternatively, this check can be disabled entirely by passing `test_output` as False.\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Specifying the model's state size\n\nState size is a number of words the probability of a next word depends on.\n\nBy default, `markovify.Text` uses a state size of 2. But you can instantiate a model with a different state size. E.g.,:\n\n```python\ntext_model = markovify.Text(text, state_size=3)\n```\n\n### Combining models\n\nWith `markovify.combine(...)`, you can combine two or more Markov chains. The function accepts two arguments:\n\n- `models`: A list of `markovify` objects to combine. Can be instances of `markovify.Chain` or `markovify.Text` (or their subclasses), but all must be of the same type.\n- `weights`: Optional. A list \u2014\u00a0the exact length of `models` \u2014\u00a0of ints or floats indicating how much relative emphasis to place on each source. Default: `[ 1, 1, ... ]`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```python\nmodel_a = markovify.Text(text_a)\nmodel_b = markovify.Text(text_b)\n\nmodel_combo = markovify.combine([ model_a, model_b ], [ 1.5, 1 ])\n```\n\nThis code snippet would combine `model_a` and `model_b`, but, it would also place 50% more weight on the connections from `model_a`.\n\n### Compiling a model\n\nOnce a model has been generated, it may also be compiled for improved text generation speed and reduced size.\n```python\ntext_model = markovify.Text(text)\ntext_model = text_model.compile()\n```\n\nModels may also be compiled in-place:\n```python\ntext_model = markovify.Text(text)\ntext_model.compile(inplace = True)\n```\n\nCurrently, compiled models may not be combined with other models using `markovify.combine(...)`.\nIf you wish to combine models, do that first and then compile the result.\n\n### Working with messy texts\n\nStarting with `v0.7.2`, `markovify.Text` accepts two additional parameters: `well_formed` and `reject_reg`.\n\n- Setting `well_formed = False` skips the step in which input sentences are rejected if they contain one of the 'bad characters' (i.e. `()[]'\"`)\n\n- Setting `reject_reg` to a regular expression of your choice allows you change the input-sentence rejection pattern. This only applies if `well_formed` is True, and if the expression is non-empty.\n\n\n### Extending `markovify.Text`\n\nThe `markovify.Text` class is highly extensible; most methods can be overridden. For example, the following `POSifiedText` class uses NLTK's part-of-speech tagger to generate a Markov model that obeys sentence structure better than a naive model. (It works; however, be warned: `pos_tag` is very slow.)\n\n```python\nimport markovify\nimport nltk\nimport re\n\nclass POSifiedText(markovify.Text):\n    def word_split(self, sentence):\n        words = re.split(self.word_split_pattern, sentence)\n        words = [ \"::\".join(tag) for tag in nltk.pos_tag(words) ]\n        return words\n\n    def word_join(self, words):\n        sentence = \" \".join(word.split(\"::\")[0] for word in words)\n        return sentence\n```\n\nOr, you can use [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) which is [way faster](https://spacy.io/docs/api/#benchmarks):\n\n```python\nimport markovify\nimport re\nimport spacy\n\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en\")\n\nclass POSifiedText(markovify.Text):\n    def word_split(self, sentence):\n        return [\"::\".join((word.orth_, word.pos_)) for word in nlp(sentence)]\n\n    def word_join(self, words):\n        sentence = \" \".join(word.split(\"::\")[0] for word in words)\n        return sentence\n```\n\nThe most useful `markovify.Text` models you can override are:\n\n- `sentence_split`\n- `sentence_join`\n- `word_split`\n- `word_join`\n- `test_sentence_input`\n- `test_sentence_output`\n\nFor details on what they do, see [the (annotated) source code](markovify/text.py).\n\n### Exporting\n\nIt can take a while to generate a Markov model from a large corpus. Sometimes you'll want to generate once and reuse it later. To export a generated `markovify.Text` model, use `my_text_model.to_json()`. For example:\n\n```python\ncorpus = open(\"sherlock.txt\").read()\n\ntext_model = markovify.Text(corpus, state_size=3)\nmodel_json = text_model.to_json()\n# In theory, here you'd save the JSON to disk, and then read it back later.\n\nreconstituted_model = markovify.Text.from_json(model_json)\nreconstituted_model.make_short_sentence(280)\n\n>>> 'It cost me something in foolscap, and I had no idea that he was a man of evil reputation among women.'\n```\n\nYou can also export the underlying Markov chain on its own \u2014\u00a0i.e., excluding the original corpus and the `state_size` metadata \u2014 via `my_text_model.chain.to_json()`.\n\n### Generating `markovify.Text` models from very large corpora\n\nBy default, the `markovify.Text` class loads, and retains, your textual corpus, so that it can compare generated sentences with the original (and only emit novel sentences). However, with very large corpora, loading the entire text at once (and retaining it) can be memory-intensive. To overcome this, you can `(a)` tell Markovify not to retain the original:\n\n```python\nwith open(\"path/to/my/huge/corpus.txt\") as f:\n    text_model = markovify.Text(f, retain_original=False)\n\nprint(text_model.make_sentence())\n```\n\nAnd `(b)` read in the corpus line-by-line or file-by-file and combine them into one model at each step:\n\n```python\ncombined_model = None\nfor (dirpath, _, filenames) in os.walk(\"path/to/my/huge/corpus\"):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        with open(os.path.join(dirpath, filename)) as f:\n            model = markovify.Text(f, retain_original=False)\n            if combined_model:\n                combined_model = markovify.combine(models=[combined_model, model])\n            else:\n                combined_model = model\n\nprint(combined_model.make_sentence())\n```\n\n\n## Markovify In The Wild\n\n- BuzzFeed's [Tom Friedman Sentence Generator](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jsvine/the-tom-friedman-sentence-generator) / [@mot_namdeirf](https://twitter.com/mot_namdeirf).\n- [/u/user_simulator](https://www.reddit.com/user/user_simulator), a Reddit bot that generates comments based on a user's comment history.
